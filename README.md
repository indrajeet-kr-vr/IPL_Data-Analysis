# IPL_Data-Analysis
Experienced in Python data analysis with a focus on sports analytics. Recently conducted in-depth analysis on IPL data, including player performance, match outcomes, and team strategies. Skilled in Pandas and Matplotlib for insightful visualization. Open to new opportunities in sports analytics and data science.
### Overview
Basic Analysis: I started by exploring basic statistics such as the number of unique cities and venues in the IPL data.

Player Analysis (Virat Kohli): I conducted a detailed analysis on a specific player, Virat Kohli, examining his total runs scored, runs scored through boundaries (4s and 6s), and runs scored through running between the wickets (1s, 2s, 3s). Visualization was done using pie charts from the Matplotlib library.

Toss Decision Analysis: I analyzed the patterns of toss decisions across different IPL seasons, learning techniques like extracting the year from timestamp data using Pandas' pd.to_datetime() function. Additionally, I explored whether winning the toss influences the outcome of the match, utilizing functions like value_counts() and pie charts to visualize the data.

Tournament Winners Analysis: I assigned a dictionary to track which teams have won the IPL tournament most frequently.

Grouped Bar Chart Analysis: Utilizing Matplotlib's grouped bar chart functionality, I visualized which teams have won the most IPL matches based on the number of matches they've played, employing the concept of joins on common features like team names.

Overall, my analysis covers a broad range of topics, from player performance to match outcomes and team success, demonstrating a good understanding of data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis techniques.
